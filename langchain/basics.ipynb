It consists of two wishbone-shaped arms that are attached to the car's chassis and the wheel hub. The upper and lower wishbones are connected to each other by a ball joint, which allows the wheel to move up and down independently of the car's body.\\n\\nWhen the car hits a bump or a pothole, the wheel moves up and down, and the suspension system absorbs the shock. The double wishbone suspension is designed to provide better handling and stability than other types of suspension systems. It allows the wheel to maintain a more consistent angle with the road surface, which improves traction and reduces tire wear.\\n\\nThe double wishbone suspension also allows for more precise control over the wheel's movement, which is important for high-performance cars. The suspension system can be adjusted to provide different levels of stiffness and damping, depending on the driving conditions.
